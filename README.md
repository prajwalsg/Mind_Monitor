Development of a Machine Learning model to analyze the impact of music on Human health using Brain signals.
(this project is still in developing phase so all codes will not be available)

INTRODUCTION
Music has played an important part in every human culture, both past and present. People around the world respond to music in a universal way and now, advances in neuroscience enable researchers to measure just how music impact on human brain. And the evidence of music activates every known part of the brain. Playing, and even just listening to, music can make us smarter, happier, healthier, and more productive at all stages of life.
With the rapid development of cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging technology, there are more and more researches focused on exploring the relationship between music and its effects on the brain. Research shows that the influence of music on people is not only Sentimental; it has a positive effect on brain development and cognitive development. Different states of the brain understand music in different ways. As a result, many researchers see music as a potential therapeutic tool than a mere entertainment, for example, the potential effect of music therapy on the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, anxiety, and people with con-centration deficiency. In our work, we are interested in learning how music impacts on human health using the brain signals and identify music features that could have caused these changes.
